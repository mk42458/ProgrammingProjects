Previous Technical Project
C programming project: The goal of this project was to excute several sub routoines and figure out errors trhough debugging 
Space Invaders: the other files were from the space invaders game and were used to produce the sound, sprites, and interrupts. The goal was to design, implement and debug 80’s or 90’s-style video game. We simplified the rules and our game used buttons and the slide pot as inputs, and the LCD and sound as the outputs. The slide pot was a simple yet effective means to move our ship and the buttons were used to shoot misiles.

Previous Technical Project:
Java Programming Project: The goal of this project was to replicate the Mastermind Game. The Driver class runs the game in either testing or player mode and the main Game class runs the game and contains all the methods.
