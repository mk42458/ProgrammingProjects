Previous Technical Project
C programming project: The goal of this porject was to excute several sub routoines and figure out errors trhough debugging 
Space Invaders: the other files were from the space invaders game and were used to produce the sound, sprites, and interrupts. The goal was to design, implement and debug 80’s or 90’s-style video game. We simplified the rules and our game used buttons and the slide pot as inputs, and the LCD and sound as the outputs. The slide pot was a simple yet effective means to move our ship and the buttons were used to shoot misiles.
